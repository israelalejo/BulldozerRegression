# BulldozerRegression

This is a Kaggle competition project that can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers

This project involved predicting the price in which a bulldozer was sold given it's features. The evaluation used was one requested by Kaggle, which was using the  RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.
